# MEM Collection API

This is a (perpetual work-in-progress) project that serves as place for managing the data of my personal entomology collection and my personal photo collection of live specimens. This repo represents the backend API of the project and uses [headless Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/headless/) for managing the project's content.

This project is likely something only I will ever find useful, but if you're interested in reading the docs, then head on over to https://docs.memcollection.com/
