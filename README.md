# MEM Collection (Wagtail)

MEM Collection is a (perpetual work-in-progress) project where I manage my personal entomology collection and my personal photo collection of live specimens. This repo represents the backend API of the project and uses [headless Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/headless/) for managing the project's content.

This project is likely something only I will ever find useful, but if you're interested in reading the docs, then head on over to https://docs.memcollection.com/
